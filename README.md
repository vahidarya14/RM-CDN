# CDN

𝗟𝗲𝘁'𝘀 𝗰𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗼𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻-𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲 𝗖𝗗𝗡 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁!

Some time ago, while working on a project, we needed a 𝗖𝗗𝗡 solution to store and manage files. Due to tight deadlines, we had to act fast to develop and deploy it.

As a result, we created a simple CDN project. While it only includes basic features, it has been highly useful for us so far.

I’d love for friends and 𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗻𝗱/𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱 experts to 𝗷𝗼𝗶𝗻 in and help refine it into a fully functional, polished project that we can 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻-𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲 for the community. This could save others from having to build similar side tools from scratch for their main projects.
